# Electronic Voting Platform

Video Demo: https://youtu.be/RGRoY0n_hOI

Welcome to my course project for CS3200. I have created an electronic voting platform that allows three different personas: **voter**, **auditor**, and **admin** to interact with the voting system.

**Voter**s can view the current candidates and cast a ballot for the candidate of their choice. This data is sent through a POST request and added to the database.

**Auditor**s can view all the votes casted so far to search for any cases of voter fraud. In the case they find something suspicious, they can submit a complaint up to an admin for them to review the situation.

**Admin**s may view all of the complaints and submit bans for any individuals by their SSN in the case of catching any voting fraud or other cases where an individual should be banned from the system.

All of the interfaces described for this system can be found on the AppSmith server.
