# Electronic Voting Platform

Video Demo: https://youtu.be/RGRoY0n_hOI

Welcome to my course project for CS3200. I have created an electronic voting platform that allows three different personas: **voter**, **auditor**, and **admin** to interact with the voting system.

**Voter**s can view the current candidates and cast a ballot for the candidate of their choice. This data is sent through a POST request and added to the database.

**Auditor**s can view all the votes casted so far
